# YouTube-Channel-Stats
A very simple program that collects channel statistics (subscribers, number of views, view count) into a CSV when given a channel name by the user. 
Mostly just my attempt to relearn Python while figuring out how to use APIs and scraping.
Note that you'll need to generate your own API key for YouTube Data API v3 should you want to use this.
